And from there, it was all up in the air. I did it through sheer willpower and willpower. There was no real way I was going to know how it was going to end. I had no way to predict how that would go either. It definitely didn't end up feeling too good.\\n\\n\\nWell, it definitely ended up feeling like it would, and what did I get out of it. I didn't get the feeling I needed to reach my goal, and the anxiety I felt at that point was far more severe when compared to what I knew it would be getting out of my heart. I would think that this time around, when I was able to go outside and feel great again, I would be able to go back in and not have all that anxiety again. Unfortunately, that never happened. I felt very bad for that.\\n\\n\\nThe reason that I feel so bad for myself now is something that has become part of my life's destiny. It's something I've been thinking about over the past 20 minutes and it's something I can't take any more responsibility for. It's a bad thing for me. That's why I decided not to even start going outside. It's because I'm afraid of going to bed after 3 or so hours of sleep. Just because this day was really hard didn't mean that I'd go out the way I wanted\"\n}"
