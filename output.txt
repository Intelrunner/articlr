    "output": "I may not have been sure about what really did interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didnt. I had no idea what I was doing, what I was looking for, what I was really doing.\n\nMy first memory of being at a party when I was twelve and I was sitting in my living room watching a movie, thinking of it, looking through the window, we were drinking some liquor and had an amazing day, then a guy suddenly comes and knocks on the door and I couldn't go in and it happened a while later that day, I said, I'm getting back on the couch, so I'm just sitting just outside my door watching some more movie I know I'm in, and I saw the big guy get out of the car and you walk up to him and he starts walking to the back of the house and he comes in this white car full of all sorts of things, and he got out and then there was this young man, looking like he was about 15 or 17, he was looking about his 50s, like 30, now he was about 20, and you can see that he was very short, very tall, very thin, and he got his hair out. And he said he was getting ready to go to college, and he was gonna be the first black President of the United States, which just goes to show you, it's true, it's true that there were people born like me in the 1960s, that it"
